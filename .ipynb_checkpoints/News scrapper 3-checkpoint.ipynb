       " <p>Speaking about the way his force would be dealing with the new Covid-19 legislation, the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police, Nick Adderley, said: “The men and women of this force are out there on the front line putting themselves in harm’s way to keep you safe, but I’ve been really clear with them.</p>,\n",
       " <p>“We will not be setting up roadblocks, we will not be stopping people in the street and asking for the purposes of their journey. </p>,\n",
       " <p>“We will be using this as an opportunity to engage, to educate, to inform, but if necessary, and if we have to impose the law, then we absolutely will. </p>,\n",
       " <p>“But I want to start off by saying we want to work with communities and with the public. </p>,\n",
       " <p>“Let’s get that message out that we are all in this together and the men and women that work for me are putting themselves in harm’s way. </p>,\n",
       " <p>“Please support us by following those rules. Please support us by doing the right thing. You are saving lives, you’re protecting the NHS and you’re saving us from having to do a more difficult task when we’ve already got a huge workload on in any case.”<br/></p>,\n",
